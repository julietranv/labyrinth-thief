# Labyrinth Thief (2016)

My first real project written in Python! :smiley:

Step 1. Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/julietranv/labyrinth-thief.git
cd labyrinth-thief
```

Step 2. Install Pygame (assuming you already have Python installed)

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

Step 3. Play!

```
python3 game.py
```
